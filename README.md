# ESP32-LED-Controller-using-HTTP
In this project, I first set up an HTTP server using Mockoon, esp-idf, and platformio. Then using the esp32's WiFi, I set the esp32 as client. Finally by making a WiFi hotspot using the esp32, I used the esp32 as HTTP server, to which we are able to send requests in order to control the built-in LED.
